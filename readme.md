#### By _**William Kulha**_

## Description

_This is a webpage that I made to practice BDD with learnhowtoprogram.com. It takes user input in the form of a string, and then returns that string 'translated' into Pig Latin._

### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
**Program Gathers User Input** | User input: 'i like pig latin' | Output: 'i like pig latin' |
**Program Makes an Array from Input** | User input: 'i like pig latin' | Output: ['i', 'like', 'pig' 'latin'] |
**Program Runs each Index of Array through a Loop to Translate** | Input: ['i', 'like', 'pig', 'latin'] | Output: ['iway', 'kelay', 'otay', 'eakspay', 'inway', 'igpay', 'atinlay'] |
**Program Joins the String and Displays the Result** | Input: ['iway', 'kelay', 'otay', 'eakspay', 'inway', 'igpay', 'atinlay'] | Output: 'Iway eallyray ikelay otay eakspay inway igpay atinlay.' |
